# Password


##Made By John Pacini


This password generator was built from the ground up with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This webpage includes button "click" event listeners to start the process. Then you will encounter a series of questions that determines how long, and what will be included in the password. Next, all the possible characters will go through a for loop to decide what the new random password will be. Once the for loop is over I used the inner.html to display the new password on the webpage.
